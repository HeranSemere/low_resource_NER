Perform Named Entity Recognition on the following sentences.
Use the BIO format with these labels: ORG, LOC, PERS.
Do NOT return tokens with other labels.
Return ONLY tokens that are part of a named entity (B-XXX or I-XXX).

Output format:
token<TAB>entity_label

Preserve sentence boundaries by leaving an empty line between sentences,
but include only the entity tokens from each sentence.
Return the entity tokens in the SAME ORDER that they appear in the original text.

If a sentence contains no named entities, output the line:
NONE NONE

Do not output anything else.
